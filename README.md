# Programming Assignment 06: Simplified Blackjack Game

## Notice

- **For this assignment you can work in a group of two or three members**
- Forming a group is totaly upto you

## Objective

This assignment is designed to test your understanding of functions, loops, decision-making, and string manipulation in Python by implementing a simplified game of Blackjack.

## Problem Statement

You will create a Python program that simulates a simplified Blackjack game where the user plays against an automated dealer. The program will handle the following tasks:

1. Generate a shuffled deck of 52 cards.
2. Allow the user to draw cards or stop at any point.
3. Automate the dealer’s card drawing based on game rules.
4. Compare hands to determine the winner.

### Tasks

1. **Generate a Deck**:

   - Implement the `generate_deck()` function to create a shuffled deck of 52 cards.

2. **Card Name**:

   - Implement the `card_name(card)` function to convert a card's string representation into a readable name.

3. **Display Hand**:

   - Implement the `display_hand(hand)` function to display the cards in a hand.

4. **Calculate Hand Value**:

   - Implement the `hand_value(hand)` function to calculate the total value of a hand, adjusting for aces if necessary.

5. **Game Logic**:
   - Implement the `main()` function to handle the game logic, including user interaction and dealer automation.

## Submission
